Muhammad Arsalan Portfolio
Static GitHub Pages frontend built with semantic HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, with a shared backend API adapter and offline-safe browser caching.

Site structure
index.html, styles.css, script.js — portfolio homepage, themes, navigation and motion
support-lab.html, support-lab.css, ai-support.js — guided IT Support Assistant
academy.html, academy.css, academy.js, academy-data.js — static Academy OS learning platform
admin.html, admin.css, admin.js — isolated local Admin Dashboard and course CRUD
resume-builder.html, resume-builder.css, resume-builder-v2.css, resume-builder.js, resume-builder-v2.js — résumé editor and PDF export
backend-client.js — shared browser-to-API adapter with offline-safe behavior
cloudflare/ — Cloudflare Worker and D1 backend implementation
assets/ — production images, diagrams, résumé PDF, and the PDF export library
Academy OS static architecture
academy-data.js is the content source of truth: course → modules → topics → prerequisites → reusable content blocks → practical work → quizzes.
academy.js contains the reusable dependency, progression, mastery, recommendation, readiness, and versioned browser-storage services.
Hash routes (#home, #course, #performance, and #topic/{id}) keep important views directly addressable on static hosting.
Academy progress, course content, resume drafts, and support sessions are backend-ready through backend-client.js. Local storage remains an offline cache. Admin write endpoints must enforce server-side authentication; no admin secret belongs in this frontend.
Backend contract
Set the API origin with the portfolio-api-base meta tag on each lab page. The frontend expects JSON at:

GET|PUT /academy/progress/:deviceId — { progress }
GET /academy/library — public learner library
GET /admin/session and PUT /admin/library — Cloudflare Access-protected Admin session and publishing
GET|PUT /resume/draft/:deviceId — { draft }
GET /assistant/session/:id and POST /assistant/session — support chat persistence
Allow only the portfolio origin through CORS. Protect /admin/* with a Cloudflare Access Allow policy containing only the owner's exact email address. Device IDs are sync locators, not authentication; use real accounts before storing private user data in production.

The Admin Dashboard is available at admin.html. Use Apply to draft for the open form, then Publish changes to persist the full content library. Export JSON backups regularly.
The isolated admin supports create, update, duplicate, reorder, publish/unpublish, delete, and undo-delete operations for courses, modules, topics, content blocks, practical tasks, prerequisites, and quiz questions.
Topic editing uses guided content-block, practical-activity, and quiz builders; authors do not need to write JSON. Use Apply to draft while editing and Publish changes when the library is ready. Ctrl/Cmd + S also publishes after validation.
cloudflare/ contains a Cloudflare Worker + D1 migration that implements the existing frontend API contract. See cloudflare/README.md for deployment and Cloudflare Access requirements.
design-system/ — typography, color, spacing, content and interaction rules for future updates
Maintenance
Keep the site framework-free and compatible with GitHub Pages. Reuse the design tokens at the top of styles.css, keep page-specific styles isolated, and update stylesheet or script version parameters in HTML after visible changes so browsers do not serve stale files.

The Resume Builder is an independent protected tool. Avoid applying homepage styles or scripts to it.
